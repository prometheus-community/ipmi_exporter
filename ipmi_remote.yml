# Configuration file for ipmi_exporter

# This is an example config for scraping remote hosts via IPMI.
# Information required to access remote IPMI interfaces can be supplied in the
# 'modules' section. A scrape can request the usage of a given config by
# setting the `module` URL parameter.

modules:
  default:
    # These settings are used if no module is specified, the
    # specified module doesn't exist, or of course if
    # module=default is specified.
    user: "default_user"
    pass: "example_pw"
    # The below settings correspond to driver-type, privilege-level, and
    # session-timeout respectively, see `man 5 freeipmi.conf` (and e.g.
    # `man 8 ipmi-sensors` for a list of driver types).
    driver: "lanplus"
    privilege: "user"
    # The session timeout is in milliseconds. Note that a scrape can take up
    # to (session-timeout * #-of-collectors) milliseconds, so set the scrape
    # timeout in Prometheus accordingly.
    # Must be larger than the retransmission timeout, which defaults to 1000.
    timeout: 10000
